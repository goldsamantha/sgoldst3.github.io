    This post is will walk you through some important parts of making your own wearable textiles that light up. To start you'll need a few things.

    For this project I used the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/659?gclid=CKWw_tX868kCFYUWHwodw54CPQ"> FLORA </a> from Adafruit.

    An image that shows all of the items and where to buy them.

    Once you have all of your supplies, you can start planning for your garment. Planning it out before you start sewing will save a lot of pain.

    It can be helpful to do a small sample circuit before you work on a larger piece to start to understand a bit more about your constraints.
    I've provided a simulation below.

    Here's some code for
  </p>
<div class="margin-top-medium">
{% highlight java %}
int led = 10;   // Look at your flora, this number corresponds
                // to the positive pin you're connected to.
int brightness =  0;  // start with no brightness
int fade_amount = 5;   // adjust this number to taste
int delay_incr = 15;   // how long to wait between light incr/decr

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

    analogWrite(led, brightness);
    brightness = brightness + fade_amount;

    if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {
      fade_amount = -fade_amount;
    }

    delay(delay_incr);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
