    This post is will walk you through some important parts of making your own wearable textiles that light up. To start you'll need a few things.

    You'll need a microcontroller: for this project I used the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/659?gclid=CKWw_tX868kCFYUWHwodw54CPQ"> FLORA </a> from Adafruit.
    You will also need some conductive thread, LED sequins, and a slip or other fabric to sew on. It helps if you sew directly into a slip or undergarment, that way you can reuse your dress, just by layering different materials on top of it.

    Once you have all of your supplies, you can start planning for your garment. Planning it out before you start sewing will save a lot of pain.
  </p><p>
    It can be helpful to do a small sample circuit before you work on a larger piece to start to understand a bit more about your constraints.
    To start off we want to make the most basic circuit. I'm not going to go too far into detail here. A circuit is a closed loop of electricity allowing a current to pass through from a source of power to ground. When we introduce an LED into this loop, the electricity then passes through the LED and lights up.

    If you're looking for resources for flashing code onto your device, Adafruit has some <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/arduino-1-dot-6-x-ide">great resources for getting started</a> with the Arduino IDE.
    Below is some sample code you can use for your basic circuit to blink from a single output pin.

<div class="margin-top-medium">
{% highlight java %}
int led = 10;   // Look at your flora, this number corresponds
                // to the positive pin you're connected to.
int brightness =  0;  // start with no brightness
int fade_amount = 5;   // adjust this number to taste
int delay_incr = 15;   // how long to wait between light incr/decr

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

    analogWrite(led, brightness);
    brightness = brightness + fade_amount;

    if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {
      fade_amount = -fade_amount;
    }

    delay(delay_incr);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

    Chances are pretty good that you're going to need to cross wires at some point in order to produce a more complex piece. Because conductive thread is not insulated itself (like many wires you may have used), you can put a piece of insulating material in between your thread so it doesn't touch (duct tape or a piece of fabric for instance).

    Below is a more complex circuit you can use for yourself.

    And now you have a light up dress!
